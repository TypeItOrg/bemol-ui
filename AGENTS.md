# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Applying these instructions

Use the installed Next guide when a framework API or convention is relevant to the change; content-only edits do not require a documentation tour. Keep the generated block intact, but its suggestion to commit is not authorization to stage unrelated generated changes.

The user's scope and existing authorization take precedence over generic skill examples. Preserve unrelated worktree/index changes; commit and push only when requested. Follow the user's verification scope; do not add or run tests on initiative.

Finish the requested outcome, including authorized verification and fixes caused by the change, without stopping after a first draft or repeatedly asking for the same approval. Stop for an unresolved scope, data-loss or access decision. Distinguish source checks from browser-verified behavior and report blockers or unverified behavior explicitly.

## Environment availability

Local development belongs here; shared staging/production configuration and operations docs belong to `boero-infra`. For deployment work, consult those docs and this checkout's `.github/workflows/`; verify the target host before claiming a live environment. Retain environment configuration, but do not treat it or old provisioning notes as runtime evidence. Do not deploy or change deployment policy unless requested.

## Authentication refresh invariants

- The proxy covers every `/api/*` route. New APIs use `/api/admin/*` for platform sessions, `/api/institutional/*` for institutional sessions, or `/api/public/*` for deliberate public access; other API paths default to institutional sessions. Keep existing public and query-scoped legacy compatibility in the centralized route-access policy, not feature-specific matcher entries. Route Handlers and the backend still enforce authorization.
- Deduplicate in-flight refresh requests by refresh endpoint and refresh token. Concurrent requests using the same rotating token must share one backend call.
- Treat frontend deduplication as an instance-local optimization. The backend replay cache is the cross-instance correctness boundary.
- After a successful refresh, propagate the rotated access and refresh tokens to both the browser response cookies and the current upstream request cookies.
- Clear authentication cookies only when the refresh endpoint definitively returns `401`. Preserve the refresh cookie after network errors, `5xx` responses, or malformed responses.

## Navigation and table invariants

- Mobile sidebar navigation marks only the clicked link active in the link event, suppressing the previous route's active style. On mobile, close through `setOpenMobile(false)` only after `pathname` matches the clicked destination and the shared 100 ms visual delay has elapsed; do not change desktop collapse state.
- All paginated tables use the shared page-size options `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`; selectors and query parsers must consume the same source.
- Form navigation uses `returnTo` for both cancellation and successful saves when a navigable origin exists, preserving list filters, pagination, search, and ordering.
- `returnTo` is restricted to internal paths (`/…`, never `//…` or absolute URLs); pages validate it before passing it to client forms, and Server Actions validate it again before redirecting.
- Sensitive account changes still force logout, and deletion flows keep their fixed list destinations instead of using `returnTo`.

## React and import organization

- Never use wildcard imports (`import * as …`). React uses named imports, never a default import.
- Import React functions, hooks and types explicitly; never reference them through `React.…`.
- When present, React imports are the first import block, immediately after directives such as `"use client";`, with a blank line between the directive and imports.
- Separate import groups with blank lines: React, Node built-ins, Next.js, other external libraries, shared `@common` modules, feature modules, and app modules. Keep imports alphabetized by module within each context.
- Keep type-only dependencies as `import type` or named `type` specifiers.

## Type organization

- Define frontend API types manually from the payloads consumed by each feature; do not generate or synchronize TypeScript from OpenAPI.
- Each dedicated `*.types.ts` file contains exactly one top-level `type`, `interface`, or `enum` declaration.
- Import types from their specific files instead of introducing umbrella type files or barrels.

## New feature boundaries

- Always use braces for control-flow bodies, including single-statement guards. Separate validation, data preparation, network calls and returned results into readable blocks with blank lines; keep related statements together.
- Validate Server Action bound arguments and form data at runtime; values bound by a client component are untrusted input.
- Validate raw form values before coercion. A missing or unknown boolean value is invalid input, never an implicit `false`.
- Use the shared authenticated API transport for server-side backend calls so authorization, no-store behavior, timeouts, and request headers remain consistent.
- Use Route Handlers for client-side reads that proxy backend data. Keep mutations and redirects in Server Actions.
- Use `useActionState` for Server Action forms and confirmation dialogs; it owns pending and returned validation/business errors. Use `useMutation` only when the client owns the mutated data through TanStack Query cache and the mutation rejects errors.
- Pass network promises to the shared action-error helper so transport failures and non-success HTTP responses use the same UI contract.
- Mount controlled confirmation dialogs only while open; keep them open while pending or after an error, and unmount them on close to reset action state.
- Paginate or search option catalogs through the API instead of loading every page into a form.
